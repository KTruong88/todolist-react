The purpose of this app was to practice React best practices. This includes: 

-Functional components with no internal state or side effects that just accept props and display it. <br />
-Single source of truth - top level component that delegates what everything else should look like and do. <br />
-Never change state directly. Copying and replacing the state will lead to better performance down the line.
